# react-lab-4
A standalone branch for my react lab

I couldn't find a location for this on my main react site, so I'm just going to link it to my main page as another site.

Lab can be located @ https://react-lab-4.corbinmeier.net/

## Background
This lab will have us build a feature using the industry practice of a "Tech Spec". You are put in the position of a developer at company executing on a feature that a more senior engineer has "Tech Specced". Please implement the feature described in the Tech Spec below.
